        Any course considered for transfer credit must be relevant to program’s objective. The decision to award transfer credit is determined by the program committee. Elective credit may be awarded for courses with no CIE equivalent if deemed relevant to the program. Courses are taken at regionally or internationally accredited institutions that are comparable to courses offered will be reviewed for course content and level by the program committee. Only those courses in which the transfer student received a grade of C or better will be evaluated for possible transfer credit.
        The program committee reserves the right to determine the eligibility of the transfer; including the contents of the transferred courses and a number of credits awarded, which could differ from the number of credits offered in the program. The program committee may appoint an appropriate faculty member to make decisions regarding transfer credit. Staff members make no transfer credit decisions.
